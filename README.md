The Program Sud2Sat inclosed is designed to take a unsolved suduko puzzle of the form 

    000001000
    100020040
    200030060
    000000000
    000000000
    000000000
    000000000
    000000000
    000000000

Where the zeros or other non-numeric characters represent unknown values ranging from 1-9. 

The program will then take the text and convert it into a cnf format with the form 123 where the 1 correspods to row the 2 corresponds to col and 3 is the value.
